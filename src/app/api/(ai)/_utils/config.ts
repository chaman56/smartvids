  {text: "input: Imagine the universe as a giant tapestry, woven from tiny vibrating strings. That's what string theory suggests. It's a revolutionary idea that tries to explain everything in the universe, from the smallest particles to the vastness of space.\\n\\nThink of a guitar string. It vibrates at different frequencies to create different notes. In string theory, these strings are even tinier, vibrating in different ways to create different particles.  \\n\\nBut there's a catch. We can't actually see these strings. They're too small, even for our most powerful microscopes.  So, string theory is more like a mathematical puzzle, trying to fit together all the pieces of the universe. It's a wild journey into the unknown, but it might just hold the key to unlocking the deepest mysteries of the cosmos."},
